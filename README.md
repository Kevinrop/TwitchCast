TwitchCast
==
A unofficial Twitch mobile app

Just a simple web app I've made to see the Twitch's Highlights and Past Broadcasts (that cannot be seen thru any app I've tested).

I've made it a while ago, but it may be usefull for someone... so i'm sharing it.

* Live streams and videos (all formats availables) on your prefered player.
* Search for Streams, Games, Channels and Teams (you need the ID).
* Check the channels you (or any user) are following.
